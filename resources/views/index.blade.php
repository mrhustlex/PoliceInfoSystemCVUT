    Project Objective :<br>
    </h3>
    <div>
    The objective of the project is to develop an Information System, designed to help Police Agent with their ongoing cases by making the information easier to access.

    To fulfill that goal, the System should keep track of the cases throughout all their life : from the opening of the case by a Police Officer to whom a crime was reported, to the closing of the Case by the chief of the department, and of course during the ongoing investigation by a detective.

    The system should also keep track of all the details relevant to a case :
<br><br>
    <li>The persons of interest involved in the case, and the information relevant to them (Name, Surname, Adress, Criminal record, statements, alibi...)
    </li>
    <li> The evidence relevant to the case
    </li><br>

            Finally, the system should keep track of the Police Agents role in the Organisation, especially regarding their clearance level and which cases they have access to see, modify, or no access at all.
<br>
    The system would run as a web application avalaible on the police station's Intranet, as well as on a backup server to prevent the loss of critical data, and ensure avalaibility.
